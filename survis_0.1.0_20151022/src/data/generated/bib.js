        "abstract": "\"Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks can significantly improve the quality of single-image super-resolution. Current researches tend to use deeper convolutional neural networks to enhance performance. However, blindly increasing the depth of the network cannot ameliorate the network effectively. Worse still, with the depth of the network increases, more problems occurred in the training process and more training tricks are needed. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale residual network (MSRN) to fully exploit the image features, which outperform most of the state-of-the-art methods. Based on the residual block, we introduce convolution kernels of different sizes to adaptively detect the image features in different scales. Meanwhile, we let these features interact with each other to get the most efficacious image information, we call this structure Multi-scale Residual Block (MSRB). Furthermore, the outputs of each MSRB are used as the hierarchical features for global feature fusion. Finally, all these features are sent to the reconstruction module for recovering the high-quality image.\",",

        "abstract": "We propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution (SR). Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes all layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage. We explore different network structures and parameter settings to achieve trade-offs between performance and speed. Moreover, we extend our network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality.",

        "abstract": "Single image super-resolution (SISR), which aims to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) observation, has been an active research topic in the area of image processing in recent decades. Particularly, deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) approaches have drawn much attention and have greatly improved the reconstruction performance on synthetic data. However, recent studies show that simulation results on synthetic data usually overestimate the capacity to super-resolve real-world images. In this context, more and more researchers devote themselves to develop SR approaches for realistic images. This article aims to make a comprehensive review on real-world single image super-resolution (RSISR). More specifically, this review covers the critical publicly available datasets and assessment metrics for RSISR, and four major categories of RSISR methods, namely the degradation modeling-based RSISR, image pairs-based RSISR, domain translation-based RSISR, and self-learning-based RSISR. Comparisons are also made among representative RSISR methods on benchmark datasets, in terms of both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. Besides, we discuss challenges and promising research topics on RSISR.",

        "abstract": "Super-resolution reconstruction technology has important scientific significance and application value in the field of image processing by performing image restoration processing on one or more low-resolution images to improve image spatial resolution. Based on the SCSR algorithm and VDSR network, in order to further improve the image reconstruction quality, an image super-resolution reconstruction algorithm combined with multi-residual network and multi-feature SCSR(MRMFSCSR) is proposed. Firstly, at the sparse reconstruction stage, according to the characteristics of image blocks, our algorithm extracts the contour features of non-flat blocks by NSCT transform, extracts the texture features of flat blocks by Gabor transform, then obtains the reconstructed high-resolution (HR) images by using sparse models. Secondly, according to improve the VDSR deep network and introduce the feature fusion idea, the multi-residual network structure (MR) is designed. The reconstructed HR image obtained by the sparse reconstruction stage is used as the input of the MR network structure to optimize the high-frequency detail residual information. Finally, we can obtain a higher quality super-resolution image compared with the SCSR algorithm and the VDSR algorithm.",

        "abstract": "To improve the issue of low-frequency and high-frequency components from feature maps being treated equally in existing image super-resolution reconstruction methods, the paper proposed an image super-resolution reconstruction method using attention mechanism with feature map to facilitate reconstruction from original low-resolution images to multi-scale super-resolution images. The proposed model consists of a feature extraction block, an information extraction block, and a reconstruction module. Firstly, the extraction block is used to extract useful features from low-resolution images, with multiple information extraction blocks being combined with the feature map attention mechanism and passed between feature channels. Secondly, the interdependence is used to adaptively adjust the channel characteristics to restore more details. Finally, the reconstruction module reforms different scales high-resolution images. The experimental results can demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve not only the visual effect of images but also the results on the Set5, Set14, Urban100, and Manga109. The results can demonstrate the proposed method has structurally similarity to the image reconstruction methods. Furthermore, the evaluating indicator of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) has been improved to a certain degree, while the effectiveness of using feature map attention mechanism in image super-resolution reconstruction applications is useful and effective.",
